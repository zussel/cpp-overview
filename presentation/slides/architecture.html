            two types of servers: controlling machines and nodes
        </li>
        <li>
            there is a single controlling machine which is where orchestration begins
        </li>
        <li>
            nodes are managed by a controlling machine over SSH
        </li>
        <li>
            controlling machine describes the location of nodes through its inventory
        </li>
        <li>
            to orchestrate nodes, Ansible deploys modules to nodes over SSH
        </li>
        <li>
            Modules are temporarily stored in the nodes and communicate with the controlling machine through a JSON protocol over the
            standard output
        </li>
        <li>
            when Ansible is not managing nodes, it does not consume resources because no daemons or programs are executing for Ansible
            in the background
        </li>
        <li>
            Ansible uses an agentless architecture, unlike Chef, Puppet, and CFEngine
        </li>
        <li>
            With an agent-based architecture, nodes must have a locally installed daemon that communicates with a controlling machine
        </li>
        <li>
            agentless type of architecture reduces the overhead
        </li>
    </ul>
